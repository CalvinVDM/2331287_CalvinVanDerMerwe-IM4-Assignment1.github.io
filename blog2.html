				The technical video this week was extremely helpful, and it aided me a lot in my understanding of APIs. Last year I struggled to grasp how APIs work and how to use them it was a real problem that cost me a lot of marks. Now that I have a better grasp on APIs, I think I will be able to incorporate them a lot better into my website and use them to a fuller potential.

				So far, I like the revision videos they help me to solidify the work we did last year, and it makes me feel more secure in the fact that I have done the coding work before but just did not understand the logic and flow as well as these revision videos help me do. The more we do, the better I think I will become, and it will help me in the long term to catch up to industry standards and produce better pieces of work.

				In terms of brainstorming, I was thinking about art in the sense of the Renaissance era, and it came to my mind to make a website based on that period. Meaning that the website would be filled with all the old oil painting styles that were popular around that period. I thought this would look cool in terms of the look and aesthetic feel of the website. I was thinking of exploring the old artwork we see in movies, such as the popular Mona Lisa, and using that artwork as a basis for designing the web pages for my website. It would feature a border and look like the content would be on a canvas or old scroll-type vibes.

				I was also thinking of having a scrolling timeline when things pop up the more you scroll down as I think this would be an interesting display of art as the pieces come together and fall into view. Like pieces of art and different patterns and special painters.

				My thoughts on the Internet are that it never seems to stop surprising me with how it changes and evolves and how it becomes something newer and better within such a small passing of time. The web is interesting because it is such a huge network that spreads and spans the entire world, allowing for innovation and things to be wide-ranging. Net art fascinates me in terms of how it is made and just how pleasing it is. I never thought of the web art that I see nowadays itâ€™s an interesting medium with loads of potential and it can become bigger and better at any moment.
