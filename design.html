It gave of a very fantasy and a vibe that reminded me of "TYPO" so i felt like it fit well. i tried to emulate the website of apple becaus ei liked the aethetic feel and th esections that it used in order to make the website feel professionally done.

								<p>
								This website is meant to be professiobal and look similar to a gallery as is the intention of the background. I took the model of the apple website and molded it to fit my expertise and theme and i think i did a great job of displayinging this. The colors and theme really bleeds through the experience and theme is constantly present throughout the website.

								<p slot = "font-text">Interface Elements : i added the cards in the blog sections for easier navigation to specific blog posts and the  user input on the homepage to stay true to the theme lastly i added an image scroll bar to the wireframes so that the looked and felt better. i added a timeline to the internet art section as well as a camera function.

								<p slot = "font-text">Style process: This website was inspire by an experience i had when i visited the standard bank gallery and it got be thinking of the arts. the experience made me feel like drawing and so i drew a few things that made me think of the past. One of those things being the Assassins creed games and my favourite title in this being the ezio collection which took place in the renaissance period.

		<h1>Thoughts & Reflection</h1>
		
		<p>
			Overall i think that my goal is underway in a very interesting format and that it is achieveable if i keep working at it. it will take some time ut the feeling is there and the aethetics look great so i think that the future iterations of this website will look awesome.
		<p>
			
		<p>
		my favouritepart of this website was looking at images and deciding which to use. this era had may bangers in terms of painting and backgrounds so i tried to be very inclusive of the images i chos eto represnt this period.
		</p>

		<p>
			lastly i think that the internet art could be better but it is well underway and evntually it will look as good as i want it to be. to conclude i give the website a 6.5/10
